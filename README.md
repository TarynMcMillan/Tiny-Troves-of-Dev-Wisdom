<p>
<b>Tiny Troves of Dev Wisdom</b> is a mini game made in Unity 2D. It was created as a beginner-friendly project for <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> 2023. 
</p>
<p>
The game is a collection of bite-sized pieces of wisdom for developers of all ages and skill levels.

<h2>How to play 🎮</h2>
<p><b>Want to play the game? You can view the current game build <a href="https://mystic-mill-games.itch.io/tiny-troves-of-dev-wisdom">here</a>.</b>
<p>Click or tap a treasure chest to reveal a piece of advice. Every quote in the game has been submitted by the project's contributors.</p>
  <p>If you have recently made a contribution but can't see it in the current build, it's probably because the build hasn't been updated yet.</p>
<p>Since Unity builds can only be generated by someone who has Unity installed locally on their machine, I'll be deploying new builds regularly throughout Hacktoberfest so that everyone gets a chance to see their contributions.</p>
