<b>Tiny Troves of Dev Wisdom</b> is a beginner-friendly project for <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">Hacktoberfest 2023</a> participants.

<h2>How to play ðŸŽ®</h2>

  <p>If you have recently made a contribution but can't see it in the current build, it's probably because the build hasn't been updated yet.</p>
<p>Since Unity builds can only be generated by someone who has Unity installed locally on their machine, I'll be deploying new builds regularly throughout Hacktoberfest so that everyone gets a chance to see their contributions.</p>
