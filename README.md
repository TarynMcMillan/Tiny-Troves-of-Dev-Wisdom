<b>Tiny Troves of Dev Wisdom</b> is a mini game made in Unity 2D. It was created as a beginner-friendly project for <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> 2023. 
</p>
<p>
The game is a collection of bite-sized pieces of wisdom for developers of all ages and skill levels.

<h2>How to contribute to the project</h2>

<b>You do not need knowledge of Unity to contribute to the project, nor do you need to run Unity locally on your machine.</b>

<h2>How to view the current game build</h2>
<p>You can view the current game build <a href="https://mystic-mill-games.itch.io/tiny-troves-of-dev-wisdom">here</a>.
  <p>If you have recently made a contribution but can't see it in the current build, it's probably because the build hasn't been updated yet.</p>
<p>Since Unity builds can only be generated by someone who has Unity installed locally on their machine, I will be deploying new builds regularly throughout Hacktoberfest so that everyone gets a chance to see their contributions.</p>
