<h1>Contributing To Tiny Troves</h1>
<p>Tiny Troves of Dev Wisdom was designed with beginners in mind.</p>
<p>This guide outlines the standard format for no-code contributions. If you would like to make a different type of contribution, please <a href="https://github.com/TarynMcMillan/Tiny-Troves-of-Dev-Wisdom/issues">open an issue</a>first.</p>
<h2>Making a no-code contribution</h2>
<ol>
<li><h3>Open up the <code>Advice.txt</code> file</h3></li>
<ul>
  <li>In the project repo, navigate to <code>TinyTroves/Assets/Advice</code>.
    <li>Click <code>Advice.txt</code> (<b>NOTE</b>: Do not modify <code>Advice.txt.meta</code>).</li>
  <li>In the top right-hand corner, click <b>Edit this file</b>.</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions to fork the repo.</li>
</ul>
  <li><h3>Add your name and piece of wisdom</h3></li>
  <ul>
  <li>Inside the <code>Advice.txt</code> file, navigate to the the next empty line in the text file.</li>
  <li>Enter in your name, followed by <code>#</code>. If your name is Bob, your entry would look like this: <code>Bob#</code></li>
  <li>Following your name, enter in your piece of advice. Please ensure that:</li>
    <ul>
  <li>Your advice is 100 characters or less.</li>
      <li>There is a space between your name and the piece of advice.</li>
      <li>Both your name and advice are no longer than one line long.</li>
  </ul>
    <li>To reiterate, each entry in the <code>Advice.txt</code> file must be no longer than one line long in order for the code to compile properly.</li>
    <li>For example, Bob's entry in the text file might look like this: 
      <p></p><code>Bob# Code like no one is watching, but always assume someone is debugging your code.</code></p>
  </ul>
  <li><h3>Start a pull request</h3></li>
    <ul>
  <li>Once you have added your entry, click <b>Commit Changes</b> in the top right-hand corner of the editor.</li>
  <li>Enter a commit message, then click <b>Propose Changes</b>.</li>
      <li>On the next screen, click the green <b>Create Pull Request</b> button.</li>
      <li><i>Optional:</i> Leave a comment on your pull request.</li>
      <li>When your pull request is ready to submit, click <b>Create Pull Request</b>.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>That's it! You can view the current build of the project <a href="https://mystic-mill-games.itch.io/tiny-troves-of-dev-wisdom">here</a>. Note that I am only able to generate new builds periodically so it may be some time after your pull request has been merged before your contribution is visible in the game.</p>
